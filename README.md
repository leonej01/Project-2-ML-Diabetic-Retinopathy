Objective: Train an algorithim to predict whether an image contains signs of diabetic retinopathy or not.


### An executive summary or overview of the project and project goals (5 points).

This project focuses on developing and evaluating supervised machine learning algorithms for the automatic detection of diabetic retinopathy (DR) in retinal images. The goal is to train binary classification models that can accurately predict whether an image shows signs of DR or not.

The MESSIDOR (Methods to Evaluate Segmentation and Indexing Techniques in the field of Retinal Ophthalmology) dataset, consisting of 1,152 patient records, is being used to train and validate the models. This dataset provides a comprehensive set of features relevant to DR diagnosis.

To optimize the performance of the machine learning models, hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering were employed. Hyperparameter tuning involves systematically adjusting the model parameters to improve the prediction scores. Additionally, feature selection techniques are being applied to identify the most informative features for DR detection.

The insights gained from this exhaustive analysis will enable the development of robust models for automatic DR screening. By incorporating these models into clinical practice, doctors can more effectively identify patients who require further eyesight evaluation, leading to improved patient care and outcomes.

The Messidor project aims not only to develop accurate DR detection models but also to compare and evaluate different segmentation and indexing techniques in retinal ophthalmology. This comprehensive approach will contribute to advancing the field of automated eye disease diagnosis and ultimately enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of DR screening programs.
